# EyeDiseaseDetection
## Project Description
The goal of the project is to create a Machine Learning algorithm that can compare eye images and categorize if there are diseases present. \
Most of these use Fundus photography that are taken with a machine that is available in places other then hospitals. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_photography \


If the research/prototype is successful I'd like to create a full on application that allows a user to import eye images and get a fast result based on the ML algorithm telling the user if any diseases have been found.

Data links:
These are links that I found that could be interesting with different levels of difficulty/reliability and their real world impact.

Dataset of eyes with and without Diabetische retinopathie:

Smaller dataset with multiple eye disease:

Dataset with images that are taken with a different more expensive machine that is not normally found outside of hospitals, but shows more interesting data:

Dataset of images with and without Glaucoma. This dataset has images that are very similar and might be more consistent for a ML algorithm to categorize:
